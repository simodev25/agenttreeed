"""Configurable multi-turn debate following AgentScope multiagent_debate pattern.

Reference: docs/agentscope/docs/tutorial/en/src/workflow_multiagent_debate.py

Key pattern from AgentScope tutorial:
- All 3 participants (bullish, bearish, moderator) are in the MsgHub
  so the moderator hears the full debate history
- Moderator is called OUTSIDE the MsgHub so debaters don't hear the verdict
- Each debater receives a specific role message (affirmative/negative side)
- Loop continues until moderator says finished (winner != None)

LLM-First: moderator MUST tranche — bullish, bearish, or no_edge.
